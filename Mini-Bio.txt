	Let's see, where to start ... I'm Victor U. Bravo.
I was born in 1990 (aka I'm 20) and raised in an area known as the Rio Grande Valley. In this hot and humid area I was raised
helping with the family busniess of running a cementary. (if you ever need a cheap headstone ...) I learned how do do all sorts
of things from fixing lawn equpment, to digging and filling a grave. Obiously, my passion isn't running a home for the dead,
it's video games, and I was introduced to them some time during my kidergarden years with my very own Super Nintendo bundeled
with The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. From there it was always a part of my life, from helping me bond with my sisters
to helping me ignore not having a dad for a year. It got harder as I got older and had to fight against my hard right parents.
	Being only 20 years old, I don't have much I can say about what I have acompleshed; high school being my greatest.
I never had a real job, but that doesn't mean I don't know how to work. During the summers I would very often be off at the
cementary 8hrs a day, monitarily the most sucessful I was to the busniess was when I went door to door in the small town of 
Combes trying to sell lots. (the cheapest around! ;D) I went to colledge for a year, however either I wasn't ready for it
or my ADD combined with being free for the first time from overprotective partens was too much. The only thing I was able to
learn was that C++ is very similar to java (a lanquage I learned in my 2nd year in The Science Academy of South Texas), or at
least the basics. One thing's for sure, thinking like a programmer translates to any language, even git bash.

That's pretty much it in a nutshell. From this point on I'm just going to talk about my gaming taste, and what I think is
missing in IGN. I don't think it adds anything too substantial to the mini bio, but feel free to keep reading. Think of the 
next parts like fun facts.

	I love Company of Heroes, all stratagy games in general but CoH takes the proverbial cake. PC gaming is not the most
popular thing in the world, which is fine. I'm not a leigonare of any platform. If given the chance though, I would love to
restart the pc podcast. If such a mirical was to accure I would have it be a 'hardcore' podcast. Where I would talk about
things like build orders, getting the most out of a unit. The audince would probably be tiny, as it is a subsect of the 
gaming pantheon. However, as gamereplays.org proves, dispite being small, the group are extramly passionate. I belive
audince participation would be high but would probably grow very slowly. I think the ign pro league is a step in the right
direction, but that doesn't mean more can be done.
