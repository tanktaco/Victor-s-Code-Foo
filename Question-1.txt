	Well first it depends what you mean by overlapping.
If it means that the pennies are not touching each other, except on the rim of the penny. Then (if I also had an 
infinite amount of jello) the question becomes if verticaly spaced the ammount of an atom of jello, how many can 
fit in the volume of the rectangular prisim created by jello with the depth and with of the Golden Gate Bridge's 
road surface and side walk, with the height of prism being the height that jello turns into liquid due to atmospheric 
pressure.
